### Hi! 👋

Hi, I’m Sean. I’m a software engineer and I’m currently completing a coding bootcamp with General Assembly, working with Python, Django, and the MERN stack. My previous career was in the arts: I’ve danced professionally in Denver, Chicago, Milwaukee and for Royal Caribbean Cruises. I was also a massage therapist for Disney on Oahu, Hawai’i. I'm taking the creativity I've honed over my career and am now implementing it in software engineering. 

While I've loved everywhere I've worked, I truly feel like entering the coding world is a home-coming: I play D&D(2e) and may or may not have a collection of Harry Potter wands. So let's just say I've found my people. I love video games 🎮, dancing 🩰, cartoons 📺, period dramas 🎭, and Dungeons & Dragons 🧙🏻‍♂️. Come say hi!
