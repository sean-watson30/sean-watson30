### Hi! üëã

Hi, I'm Sean! I am a passionate and eager software developer, driven by structure and efficiency to solve problems to benefit the user experience and satisfy the customer. I graduated a coding bootcamp with General Assembly in 2022, working with Python, Django, and the MERN stack. My previous career was in the arts: I‚Äôve danced professionally in Denver, Chicago, Milwaukee and for Royal Caribbean Cruises. I was also a massage therapist for Disney on Oahu, Hawai‚Äôi. I bring with me years of experience in management and customer service working for nonprofits and Fortune 500 companies as well as over a decade of discipline and creativity from being a professional dance artist.

While I've loved everywhere I've worked, I truly feel like entering the coding world is a home-coming: I play D&D(2e) and may or may not have a collection of Harry Potter wands. So let's just say I've found my people. I love video games üéÆ, dancing ü©∞, cartoons üì∫, period dramas üé≠, and Dungeons & Dragons üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Come say hi!
